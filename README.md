# cgmapping
This repository has the main purpose to serve as dwell for my masters final project code for future generations to find.

The mapping part as left for future updates, right now only cuLINA (cuda LINear Algebra) and cuDVO (cuda Dense Visual Odometry) works, although the later is labeled cgmapping.
